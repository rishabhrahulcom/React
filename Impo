React DOm

const creating_a_react_element = React.createElement("Tag we want to creat",{id:"whatever"},"children of the heading");
                              -> create an object
                              -> when we render this element on to dom, this become a HTML element
                              -> To render, we need to create a Root,
                              @-> const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"))
                                -> root.render(creating_a_react_element)
                              --> whatever will happens inside the react will happened inside the root.
                              ----> and this will be render by the HTML page

                              React is fast because of virtual dom manipulation


                              when to call shimmer UI
